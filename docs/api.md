# API 21GAM

Base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`. This document describes the implemented Express API, including its current limitations. Paths below are relative to that base URL.

## Transport and authentication

- JSON uses UTF-8; successful requests return 200 unless stated otherwise.
- Login sets an HttpOnly session cookie. Send that cookie on subsequent requests (`credentials: 'include'` in the browser).
- Every POST, PUT and PATCH requires `Origin` equal to `WEB_ORIGIN` (normally `http://localhost:5173`). Login also requires the trusted origin.
- Every authenticated mutation requires `X-CSRF-Token` from login or `/auth/me`. Store the token in memory. Logout revokes the session and clears its cookie.
- Actors, organization and venue are determined by the authenticated session. Request bodies cannot choose another organization, venue or user. Booking sources belong to the organization; bookings, tables, visits and waitlist belong to the active venue.
- All business routes require authentication and their listed permissions. Permissions are checked on every request, including after role revocation.
- Existing-entity writes require the current positive integer `version`. The status compatibility route uses optional `expectedVersion`. Stale versions return 409. Do not automatically retry mutations.
- `Idempotency-Key` is not enforced. Disable duplicate submission in clients.
- `businessDate` is a valid `YYYY-MM-DD`; response instants are ISO-8601 UTC strings. Booking `expectedAt` must include an offset and represent local time in `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` (normally `+07:00`). Business hours are 17:00 through before 05:00 the next morning; after midnight belongs to the previous business date.
- There is no subscription/change-feed endpoint. Clients may poll and refetch after successful mutations.

Errors use:

```json
{"error":{"code":"VERSION_CONFLICT","message":"Booking v?a ???c thay ??i. Vui l?ng t?i l?i."}}
```

Common status codes: 400 `INVALID_*` validation, 401 `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` / `SESSION_INVALID`, 403 `PERMISSION_DENIED` / `CSRF_TOKEN_INVALID` / `ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED`, 404 entity not found in the actor's scope, 409 stale version or allocation conflict, 422 `INVALID_PHONE_NUMBER` / `BOOKING_PHONE_UNAVAILABLE`, 429 rate limit, 503 `PHONE_*_UNAVAILABLE`. Duplicate keys map to `RESOURCE_CONFLICT`; database deadlocks/lock timeouts map to `CONCURRENT_UPDATE_RETRY`. Internal failures return a generic 500 without SQL or secrets.

## Health and session

| Method | Path | Access | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Public | `{ok:true}`; process liveness, not a database check |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Trusted origin | Body `{username,password}`; returns `{user,permissions,csrfToken,expiresAt}` and session cookie |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Session | `{user,permissions,csrfToken}` |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Session + CSRF | 204, no body |

`user` contains `{id,username,displayName,organizationId,venueId}`. Raw session tokens are never included in JSON. Login is limited after five failed attempts for the same IP/username in a 15-minute window.

## Tables and catalog

| Method | Path | Permission | Request / response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/tables/catalog` | `customer.view_masked` | `{venue,zones,tables,combinations}` |
| GET | `/tables?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | `customer.view_masked` | `{businessDate,tables:TableView[],groups:FloorGroupView[]}` |
| PATCH | `/tables/:id/status` | `table.assign` | Body `{businessDate,state,expectedVersion?,reason?}`; see limitation below |
| PATCH | `/tables/:id/configuration` | `venue.configure` | Body `{isSpare?:boolean,status?:"ACTIVE"|"OUT_OF_SERVICE",version,reason}`; returns `{table:{id,code,isBackup,status,version}}` |

`TableView` contains `{id,code,displayName,type,capacity,area:{code,name,floor},position:{x,y},state,isBackup,version,activeVisit}`. `state` is `AVAILABLE`, `RESERVED`, `IN_USE` or `OUT_OF_SERVICE`. `activeVisit` is null or `{id,version,tableCodes,displayName,phoneLast3,guestCount,startedAt,origin,paid,note}`. The floor shows allocations for the requested business date. `FloorGroupView` is `{id,symbolNo,tableIds}` and contains active groups with at least two allocations.

Catalog venue fields include `id,version,name,timezone,businessDayStartLocal,businessDayCutoffLocal,lateWarningMinutes,noShowWarningMinutes,waitlistHoldDefaultMinutes,waitlistClaimLeaseSeconds,reservationHoldPolicy,reservationWindowMinutes,groupSymbolCount,changeSeq`. Zones contain `id,version,code,name,isBookable,isWaitingArea`. Catalog tables contain `id,version,code,displayName,zoneId,zoneCode,kind,capacity,seqNo,isSpare,status,x,y,width,height`. Combinations contain `id,code,displayName,memberIds,capacity`.

**Direct status changes are unsupported in v1.** The status route accepts `AVAILABLE`, `RESERVED` or `IN_USE`, verifies table organization/venue (404 outside scope), checks `expectedVersion` if present (409 `VERSION_CONFLICT`), then returns 409 `TABLE_STATE_DERIVED`. It never creates an allocation, modifies the table or writes a mutation audit event. Use assign, check-in, move and close instead. Use the owner-only configuration route for manual `OUT_OF_SERVICE` / `ACTIVE` changes.

Spare configuration is persistent rather than per-day. `reason` is required, at most 500 characters. Provide at least one of `isSpare` or `status`; status supports `ACTIVE` and `OUT_OF_SERVICE`. The table must have no unreleased allocations (holds or visits, on any date), and at least one supplied value must change. `venue.configure` is granted only to OWNER_ADMIN. Successful configuration changes audit the actor and bump the table version. Sending `isBackup` to the status route returns 400 `FIXED_SPARE_TABLE`.

## Bookings

| Method | Path | Permission | Request / response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/bookings?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | `customer.view_masked` | `{businessDate,bookings:BookingView[]}` |
| GET | `/bookings/sources` | `customer.view_masked` | `{sources:[{code,name}]}`; active organization sources |
| GET | `/bookings/search?date=YYYY-MM-DD&q=...` | `customer.view_masked` | `{businessDate,query,bookings}`; up to 100 results |
| GET | `/bookings/export?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | `customer.view_masked` | UTF-8 `text/plain` attachment, masked phones |
| GET | `/bookings/:id` | `customer.view_masked` | `{booking:BookingView}` |
| POST | `/bookings` | `reservation.create` | Body `BookingInput`; 201 `{booking}` |
| PUT | `/bookings/:id` | `reservation.update` | Body `BookingInput` plus `version`; `{booking}` |
| POST | `/bookings/:id/assign` | `table.assign` | Body `{version,tableIds}`; `{booking}` |
| POST | `/bookings/:id/merge` | `visit.combine` | Body `{version,tableIds}`; `{booking,group:{id,symbolNo,tableIds}}` |
| POST | `/bookings/:id/cancel` | `reservation.cancel` | Body `{version,reasonNote?}`; `{booking}` |
| POST | `/bookings/:id/no-show` | `reservation.mark_no_show` | Body `{version}`; `{booking}` |
| POST | `/bookings/:id/check-in` | `visit.checkin` | Body `{version}`; `{booking}` |
| POST | `/bookings/:id/phone:reveal` | Both `booking.phone.reveal` and `customer.phone.reveal` | `{phoneNumber}`; owner-only under seeded roles |
| POST | `/bookings/walk-ins` | `visit.walkin` | Body `{partySize,businessDate,tableIds,guestName?}`; 201 `{visitId}` |

`BookingInput`:

```json
{
  "guestName":"Kh?ch ??t b?n",
  "partySize":4,
  "expectedAt":"2030-10-24T20:00:00+07:00",
  "businessDate":"2030-10-24",
  "sourceCode":"HOTLINE",
  "note":"Ghi ch? t?y ch?n",
  "phoneNumber":"0987654321"
}
```

`guestName` is required (1-120 characters), `partySize` 1-500, `sourceCode` must exist and be active, `note` at most 500 characters. `phoneNumber` is optional: omitted on update retains the existing phone; null or blank removes it; a nonblank value is validated and encrypted. Update sends the complete booking fields, not a partial patch. Cancel `reasonNote` is at most 300 characters.

`BookingView` is `{id,guestName,phoneLast3,partySize,expectedAt,businessDate,status,source,sourceCode,tableCodes,note,version,displayStatus,minutesLate,autoNoShowDue}`. `status` is `BOOKED`, `CHECKED_IN`, `CANCELLED` or `NO_SHOW`. Search matches guest names or exactly three trailing phone digits. List, detail, search, export and mutation responses never contain a full stored phone or cryptographic fields.

Booking creation does not allocate tables or create a visit. Assign creates/replaces a hold; check-in requires an assigned booking and converts the hold to a visit/usage allocation. Cancel/no-show are explicit staff actions for `BOOKED` reservations and release their holds. Warnings after 15 and 30 minutes do not cancel or release anything. `NO_SHOW_WORKER_ENABLED` remains false.

Merges preserve existing tables, add at least one table, require compatible kinds in one zone and sufficient combined capacity, and create/reuse an active group symbol. Assignments reject spare/inactive tables and occupied allocations. The backend locks table rows and revalidates concurrent requests; a lost race returns 409 rather than double seating. No fixed seating duration is assumed.

Walk-ins require the current business date during operating hours; errors are `WALK_IN_OUTSIDE_BUSINESS_HOURS` or `BUSINESS_DATE_NOT_CURRENT`. A reservation for another date does not authorize a walk-in for that date.

### Phone protection

Receptionists never receive a full stored phone, including from `phone:reveal`. That route requires both permissions above; an owner can explicitly reveal a number. It applies per-user/booking rate limits, writes a redacted audit record before returning a number, and sets `Cache-Control: no-store, private, max-age=0` plus `Pragma: no-cache`. Audit failure prevents disclosure. Missing encryption/HMAC keys or rate-limit policy fail closed with 503.

Migration 0004 revokes the historical `booking.phone.reveal` grant from RECEPTIONIST. Both `booking.phone.reveal` and `customer.phone.reveal` remain required in code; only OWNER_ADMIN has the reveal grant in the current roles.

## Visits

| Method | Path | Permission | Request / response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/visits/:id/close` | `visit.end` | Body `{version,mode:"MANUAL",reason,note?}`; `{visit:ClosedVisitView}` |
| POST | `/visits/:id/move` | `visit.move` | Body `{version,tableIds,note?}`; `{visit:MovedVisitView}` |
| POST | `/visits/:id/merge` | `visit.combine` | Body `{version,tableIds}`; `{visit:MovedVisitView,group:{id,symbolNo,tableIds}}` |

Manual close reasons are `GUEST_LEFT` or `ENTRY_ERROR`; note is optional, at most 500 characters. Closing releases the visit allocations and dissolves unused groups. `ClosedVisitView` is `{id,businessDate,status:"CLOSED",endedAt,endReason,version,releasedTables:[{id,code}]}`. `MovedVisitView` is `{id,businessDate,version,previousTables:[{id,code}],tables:[{id,code}]}`. Move validates connected target tables and capacity; merge follows the group rules above.

`AFTER_PAYMENT` is recognized but rejected because a trusted payment verifier is unavailable (`PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE`). The API does not provide a payment-confirmation endpoint.

## Waitlist

| Method | Path | Permission | Request / response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/waitlist?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | `customer.view_masked` | `{businessDate,entries:WaitlistEntryView[]}` |
| POST | `/waitlist` | `waitlist.create` | Body WALK_IN `{kind?:"WALK_IN",guestName,partySize,businessDate,contactChannel,note?}` or ADVANCE `{kind:"ADVANCE_RESERVATION",reservationId,businessDate,contactChannel,note?}`; 201 `{entry}` |
| POST | `/waitlist/:id/seat` | `waitlist.accept_offer` + `visit.walkin`; advance also `table.assign` + `visit.checkin` | Body `{version,tableIds}`; `{entry,visitId}` |
| POST | `/waitlist/:id/cancel` | `waitlist.cancel` | Body `{version,reasonCode,note?}`; `{entry}` |
| POST | `/waitlist/:id/contact-attempts` | `waitlist.record_contact` | Body `{version,channel,outcome,note?}`; `{entry}` |

`WaitlistEntryView` is `{id,kind,guestName,partySize,businessDate,queuedAt,status,contactChannel,reservationId,reservationExpectedAt,visitId,note,version}`. `kind` is `ADVANCE_RESERVATION` or `WALK_IN`; omitted kind creates `WALK_IN`. Advance entries require a BOOKED reservation in the actor organization/venue on the same business date, without active holds or allocations; an existing non-terminal entry returns 409. Guest name and party size come from the reservation and must not be sent for advance entries. `reservationExpectedAt` is the ISO UTC appointment time for advance entries and null for walk-ins. Lists order by priority_class (advance before walk-in), queuedAt, then id. `status` is `WAITING`, `CONTACTING`, `OFFERED`, `HOLD_ACTIVE`, `SEATED`, `DECLINED` or `CANCELLED`. The response has no phone field.

Creation validates guest name (1-120), party size (1-500), date, channel and note (at most 500 characters). Its `contactChannel` values are `IN_PERSON`, `PHONE_CALLBACK`, `ZALO_THREAD`, `FANPAGE_THREAD`, `OTHER`.

Seat supports WALK_IN entries in WAITING and ADVANCE_RESERVATION entries in WAITING, CONTACTING or OFFERED. Advance seating assigns tables and checks the reservation in within one transaction, creates exactly one RESERVATION visit only at seating, marks the entry SEATED and writes WAITLIST_SEATED. Cancelling or no-showing a reservation closes its open entry with RESERVATION_CANCELLED in the same transaction. Direct check-in through the booking route also closes an open advance entry as SEATED_OTHERWISE and audits that closure atomically. No offer or hold automation is introduced. It locks entry and table rows, rejects stale versions and occupied/spare/inactive tables, creates a visit and usage allocations, marks the entry `SEATED`, and audits the actor in the same transaction.

Cancel supports all non-terminal statuses (`WAITING`, `CONTACTING`, `OFFERED`, `HOLD_ACTIVE`). Allowed `reasonCode` values from the existing schema are `CUSTOMER_DECLINED`, `CUSTOMER_WITHDREW`, `NO_SHOW_AFTER_ACCEPT`, `RESERVATION_CANCELLED`, `SEATED_OTHERWISE`, `DUPLICATE`, `ENTRY_ERROR`, `OTHER`. Note is optional, at most 300 characters. Cancellation clears a contact claim and explicitly releases the entry's active waitlist hold/allocations, dissolves unused groups, records closure metadata and bumps the entry version. Cancelling a booking-linked entry does not cancel the reservation. Audit `WAITLIST_CANCELLED` and all domain changes commit together.

Contact recording uses the existing `waitlist_contact_attempts` table. Its channel values differ from creation: `IN_PERSON`, `PHONE_BY_AUTHORIZED`, `ZALO_THREAD`, `FANPAGE_THREAD`, `OTHER`. Outcomes are `NO_ANSWER`, `CALLBACK_REQUESTED`, `OFFER_PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `DECLINED_OFFER`, `KEEP_WAITING`, `WITHDREW`, `WRONG_CONTACT`. Note is optional, at most 300 characters. The entry lock serializes attempt numbering; each completed attempt records the authenticated user, server timestamps, channel/outcome/note, bumps entry version and writes `WAITLIST_CONTACT_RECORDED` atomically. Recording an outcome does not change entry status or create an offer, hold or visit. Terminal entries reject both mutations with 409 `WAITLIST_TERMINAL`; stale versions return 409 `VERSION_CONFLICT` first. Unknown/out-of-scope entries return 404 `WAITLIST_NOT_FOUND`.

## Unavailable capabilities

There are no implemented endpoints for customer search/profile/notes, operation-log listing, undo/redo, reports, venue configuration, zone flags, hold deadlines/releases, group split, waitlist claim/release-claim, or standalone visits/allocations lists. A catalog exposing lease/hold configuration does not imply that those write APIs exist. Unknown routes return 404; HTTP adapters may expose these unavailable methods as explicit 501 `NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_BACKEND` errors. Direct table-state writes and payment-verified closing have the restrictions described above.

## Verification

Run from `Bar_management/api`:

```powershell
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
$env:DB_NAME='gam21_platform_it_test'
$env:RUN_MYSQL_INTEGRATION='1'
npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism
```

The test setup refuses any other database when MySQL integration is enabled. It generates throwaway encryption/HMAC keys and an explicit reveal rate-limit policy before application imports. No deployment phone key or `.env` edit is needed. Fixtures are destructive and belong only to the isolated, migrated integration database. Never run them against the development database.
